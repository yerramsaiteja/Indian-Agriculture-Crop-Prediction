1. Executive Summary:
This project aims to leverage historical agricultural data from India to predict crop yields using and visualize the results through interactive dashboards in
PowerBI. By analyzing data spanning from 1997 to 2020, the project seeks to provide valuable
insights into agricultural trends, supporting better decision-making for farmers, policymakers,
and researchers.
2. Problem Statement:
Problem: Accurately predicting crop yields in India using historical agricultural data poses a
significant challenge due to diverse factors like weather variations, agricultural practices, and
economic influences.
Objective: To deliver a detailed, interactive, and visually compelling dashboard that
illustrates crop production trends, seasonal variations, and geographical distributions across
India.
Significance: Achieving accurate yield predictions will empower stakeholders with actionable
insights to optimize agricultural planning, resource allocation, and policy-making, thereby
enhancing food security and economic stability in India.
3. Data Sources:
Primary data
1. Agricultural Production: Data on crop types, states, districts, years, areas cultivated,
and production quantities.
2. Weather and Climate: Information including rainfall, temperature, and humidity
affecting crop growth.
3. Agricultural Inputs: Details on fertilizer usage, pesticide application, irrigation
methods, and soil quality.
Secondary data
1. Geospatial Data: GIS layers for states, districts, and agroecological zones.
2. Economic Data: Market prices, government policies, subsidies, and economic indicators
related to agriculture.
3. Satellite Imagery: Provides vegetation indices, land use/land cover, and crop health
assessments.
4. Methodology:
Data Integration: Extract and integrate data from various sources into Tableau/Power BI.
Dashboard Design: To identify key metrics and design visually appealing dashboards.
Interactivity: Implement interactive features for drill-down analysis and trend exploration
5. Expected Outcomes:
 To provide a detailed and interactive dashboard that illustrates crop production trends,
seasonal variations, and geographical distributions across India
 Empower stakeholders with insights to enhance agricultural planning, policy-making,
and resource allocation.
6. Tools and Technologies:
Power BI: Create interactive dashboards to visualize and explore crop yield prediction
Python: Data Preprocessing and data cleaning
7. Risks and Challenges:
 Handling large volumes of data can affect the performance and speed of dashboards.
 Integration challenges may arise while connecting to diverse data sources.
 Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across dashboards
8. Conclusion:
leveraging Power BI for intuitive data visualization and Python for advanced analytics
empowers agricultural projects with actionable insights, fostering improved decision-making
and productivity outcomes.
